### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a basic investing program that shows how monthly deposits can impact the overall growth of an investment versus a single, initial deposit alone.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think that overall my code was extremely clear and concise, as well as using .cpp and .h files apporpriately.  This was my first assignment of which I tried to keep the main.cpp clear of as much excess code as possible, and I think I was able to acheive that.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could have done a better job with error handling.  I think that the 3rd project of the term gave me a better grasp on the importance and implementation of error handling, so if I had to go back and improve the code, I would focus on that.  

### Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I have to admit I did do alot of googling to figure out the best what to maniuplate the code the way I wanted it to work.  I learned a lot about #include statement, and using certain libraries, I was able to achieve the results I wanted to.  Honestly, I think just having the ability to search or troubleshoot my problems through the internet in general has proven most valuble.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

This was the program that I used seperate source and header files apart from the main.cpp.  Knowing how to use seperate files is foundational knowledge to programming and so being able to successfully implement this will help immensely for other courses and projects in the future.  This was also the first project that I had to build from the ground up, so successfully understand C++ styling and common naming semantics will also prove valubale in the future.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Sticking to the syling guielines set forth in the project specs makes this program easy to maintain because a fellow programmer would be able to easy follow after me and update the file as needed.  The styling guides also help with readability and makes it easy to adapt and update as needed.

## CS230 -- designtemplate

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms from their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which currently is only available on Android. The development for the web-based version is being outsource to our team to help streamline the process.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think that I had a good grasp on the UML class diagram as well as the coding itself in the project, I think that it was easy to understand and follow as well as where to go with the code from the document.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I really liked delving into the different specifications of the operating systems (more specifically the chart). I think it really helped me understand what the big differences are between the main operating systems that can be found desktop/laptops.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I probably would have had to go with fixing the code a bit more to make sure that it ran properly.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The client wanted to make sure that the game has the ability to have or more teams, each team will need to have players assigned to it, each team and game names must be unique, and only one instance of a game can exist at a give time. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because their goals for functionaity are what is most important to a project. If the app doesn't function like the user wants it to, then the project wouldn't be considered a success.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

To design the software, I used the UML diagram as well as the specifications provided to develop the code. I think overall this was a pretty successful approached but I feel like there could have been some improvments made to the process that would have helped with the project in the long run. I think using psuedocode to build a framework from the UML is really helpful for me to understand where to go with the code. I also think that having a better understanding of operating systems will help when it comes to porting applications from one OS to another. Finally, I think that looking back through the different design templates will help with foundational knowledge of design.

## CS250 -- finalproject7.1

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are different features and functionalities that users would want included in a program or solution for a particular task.  The best way to interpret user needs are by creating user stories "As a user I want... so that..." which clearly defines and standardizes user needs in a set template that is easy to understand.  User stories then can be taken then to create test cases to test the functional code for that user story as it is completed.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I going into a coding assignment or project, I look at that the goals or objectives that the code should be able to do at the end of the process.  I usually will set different points throughout the project to test the code before continuing so that I can catch issues that might further set me back if not looked into.  This process is usually repeated until the project is functional and the code is complete.  I think that part of my process is agile in that I usually incrementally break up the project so that I can test the code to make sure that it works properly.  I think that I should spend a bit more time and "standardizing" my goals and objectives by using user stories becuase then I could find better points to stop and test the code based of of each user story.  I also think that QI'ing myself almost like a sprint retrospective after each project and reflect on what could be done better or what I could improve on would help me improve steadily as I continue to comeplete projects and work on different code.  

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member in software development should have quite a few different qualities that will help someone become a valuable asset to the team.  I think communcation and transparency are both key in software development because making sure questions or concerns are cleared up as timely as possible will only help the team further progress.  Transparency in understanding ones strengths and weaknesses can help develop a better skill set as well as keeps the team on the same page on in terms of who to go to if questions do arise.  Being skilled in coding is very important for the overall product but I think interpersonal skills like communcation are foundational in team developement and success.  I also think having the ability to take constructive feedback and apply them to future processes is also important for a good team member because being able take critiques from others and apply them helps build teama rapport as well as foster realtionships amongst team members.   

## CS320 Contact/ContactService and Testing

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure that code is functional and secure is by testing the program to make sure it meets software requirements and security standards.  Testing can be used to make sure the functionality of the software is where it needs to be as well as making sure that vulnerabilites in the code are found and corrected.  

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Taking user needs and interpreting them into test cases or requirements ensure that the program meets the expectiations of the user by matching need to funcitonality.  Breaking down the wants and needs of the user into incremental, function driven blocks will help meet the requirements without overloading the program with unwanted or unnecessary features.

### How do I approach designing software?

When I first approach a project or program, I try and make sure I fully understand the requirements so that I can align them with tangible code that can be developed.  This gives me an outline of where to start, and what steps I need to take to meet each requirement.  After each requirement has been completed, the next step would be to test the program to make sure that testing coverage hits eah test case developed for the program.  

## CS305 - Software Security

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis finanical was a global finance firm that was in the process of updating their web application and wanted a consultation on their security protocols to make sure that they are at the forefront of their security for their site.

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think in the project I was particularly good at analyzing the Maven vulnerability report and determining which vulernabilities needed to be addressed and how to fix them.  Coding securely is important because it prevents unauthorized users from crashing the programs and its functionality and give the hacker access to sensitive information.  


### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I think that the first time I used a vulnerability report, it seemed kind of daunting and more complicated than it really was.  After going through the tutorial lesson of how to analyze the report and going through the process itself, I think that th report is really helpful in evaluating the plugins and packages used for software development and how to address security issues in the development process.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I think that learning how to use the vulnerability assessment flow diagram was the most important lesson learned in the class. This helped breakdown the different challenges in the development process that could arise and how to address each area to make the software more secure.  Each layer of security needs to be looked at on how in improves the security of the software but as well as how it complements the security as a whole.  Each individually are important, but their overall role in the security picture is much more important.

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The best way to ensure that the code and the application itself was functional and secure was to make sure that as each security implementation takes place, the overall funcationality of the code is not impacted.  This can be checked using the vulnerbility assessment, as well as running the code or testing the code for security.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I think that understanding the concepts of how keys work and encryption fucntions from a conceptual standpoint is important in understanding security as well as using Maven to evaluate different third party resources for vulnerabilities.  

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I think that this vulnerability assessment shows that as a software developer, I have a working knowledge of the principles of secuirty as well as having a proactive approach on the impacts on security on development as a whole.  I also think that the progress throughout the class shows that i know how to take different approaches to security and infuse them into the finished product by adding these layers of security through the developement process. 

## CS-255 System Analysis and Design

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client in this project was DriverPass.  DriverPass is a company that recognizes the need for an improved student driving experience and wants to develop a web based, cloud service product to help meet these needs for the student driver.  They need to be able to manage driving appointments, provide feedback to the student, and provide learning resources to help a driving student succeed and pass their exams.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think that for this assignement, my UML diagrams were very well put together, had a logical flow to them, and explain the processes that needed to be implemented for the project to be successful.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part of the project that I struggled with was evaluating and outlining technical requirements needed foe this system to be built.  I think I would have spent a bit more time breaking down the techinical requirements as well as done a bit more research into what the system really needed from a tech standpoint.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs were implemented by being able to draw a clear line back from the use case, class diagram, etc. to the client discussions and having a clear connection from the beginning of the project to the functionality the the product provided for the client.  User needs are important to consider during the design because they are a measure of the products success.  If the requirements aren't met or the functionality isn't delivered, then the product is ultimately a failure.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When thinking about the design process, the most important place to start the planning and functionality requirements is to start with the client meetings and to figure out what the need for the design is, and what is expected for th implementation.  Then from there, buidling the system from tangible goals set forth from the meeting will provide the pathway to a successful project.  I think that I would definitely use the use case diagrams to brainstorm all the possible processes of the system and furher break that down into processea and class diagrams and relationships between the parts and modules of the complete system.  After development, I think that circling back and connection the dots between the system and its met functonal requirments will help make sure that things aren't missed in the final product.


### CS-330: Comp Graphic and Visualizations

## How do I approach designing software?
## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I think that the biggest thing that this project helped me with was understanding to concept of modulization in terms of break up pieces of code into function parts that can be check and tested to make up the final project.  Each week, a different module was made for the final 3D scene and understanding how it was broken up helped me understand that important piece of design.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

I started with the scene I wanted to go with and i broke the scene up into pieces based on the object i was creating and what needed to go into the object to make it look as real as possible.  Having a plan of how to approach the scene iself was key in the foundation before shaders, textures, and lighting were added to make the final piece.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I think that having a blueprint in terms of any project is the best way to move forward, without something to reference, this would have been a much harder project to complete.

## How do I approach developing programs?
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Again, I think the biggest strategy I learned from this project in the concept of modules and beaking things up into functional pieces (especially for testing).

## How did iteration factor into your development?

Through the projects lifecycle, each iteration included a different piece of making the scene more complete (shading, color, texture, lighting, etc.). Also with the framework of the objects themselves, each iteration had varible differences to make the final piece look liek the reference image.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

I think that in this case, testing was my biggest focus in terms of seeing what was working and what wasnt.  I probably rendered the 3D scene 100s of times, each with a different test or change to see what pathway worked the best.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I think that this class has really help understand the importance of consistently testing code as changes are made to make sure the project progess is moving the right direction.  Also better understanding the concept of modules.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I think this circles back to the concepts mentioned in the last question.  These are going to make me a better developer.


### CS-340 -- Client/Server Development


## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Programs that are well documented and organized are the best way to keep them maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  Advantages in working this way are being able to utlize the module in a wider range of applications because its east to update to fit specific funcationality.  The CRUD module was developed using MongoDB but applied in a DASH application to make the database visually easier to search, edit, and understand from its CSV format.  This module could be used to organize or understand different suppliers in an online shop, it could be used to analyze weather data to predict or understand changes in climate.


## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists leverage techonology to help meet the needs or functionality that would otherwise be impossible without technology.  This matters because using technology to solve problems, simplfy processes, or understand complex data, can really make a huge impact on the success of a company.  For example, leveraging technology by a company like Grazioso Salvare, helps improve the overall training of shelter dogs into rescue dogs.  This ultimately could help save lives if the best dogs are trained for specific scenarios they are more likely to excel at.  

### CS-350 Emerging Systems Arch and Tech

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The two artifacts I chose to upload that best reflects my work in this class is the Milestone 2 project and the final project.  In the 2nd milestone I was tasked with programming the microcontroller to turn on/off depending on if "ON"/"OFF" were typed on the keyboard as an input.  The final project was to program the microcontroller to act as a thermostat.  The side GPIO buttons were used to control the set temperature and the I2C was used to read the temperature from the sensor in the microcontroller.  UART was used to display the temp, set temp, heat on/off as binary, and elapsed seconds of the system and the red output light was programmed to turn on if the temp was below the set point (effectively turning the heat "on").

## What did you do particularly well?

I think that in these assigments, I was able to pick up on how different functions of the microcontroller interacted with each other and how to implement the funcitonality of each assignement by unerstanding these functions.  I also think that my task scheduler setup was efficient and effective.

## Where could you improve?

I think that the implemetation of state machines was the most complicated part of the class for me in terms of applying the concept.  Milestone 3 was difficult for me to understand, but I eventually figure it out.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the biggest thing this term that I learned was to lean on my peers a bit for concepts I didn't understand and work as a team to push forward with difficult assigments.  I tend to fly solo when it comes to my academic career but have a feew peers to bounce ideas off of was extremely helpful for this class.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The most transferable skill that I learned from this class is understanding imported header and class files and how they can be used together to implement different functionalities in code.  Taking the time to read through and understand now they work really helped pull everything together for an assignment.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think that the final project was my best work in regards to organization of code and annotation of how things were working.  This makes the code so much more eas to read and maintain if other features are going to be implemented in the future.

## CS360 - Mobile Application Development

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For this mobile application, I designed an event tracking app that the user could add, remove, and edit events to their list of events in the application.  The application had to have a log-in page that was linked to a database to verify the user had an account and that the username and passwords matched what was in the database.  After log-in, a separate database for events was used to build the recyclerView of events that the user could populate.  The app also explores the concept of permissions in Android and how to request permissions from the user to access different functionality of the mobile device.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To meet the necessary requirements of user functionality, there had to be a log-in screen, create account screen, as well as a home screen that lists the users events.  There also had to be screens that gave the user the ability to add or edit events to their database. For the account database, the app needed to be able to create and read from it so that an account could be created and usernames/passwords checked to authorize the log-in.  For the event database, the app needed to be able to create, read, update, and delete from it to meet all the user needs of the app.  The goal for the UI of the application was to keep it as simple as possible while still adhering to accessibility goidelines so that it is usable by as many people as possible.  I think that the designs were successful in that they met the user needs but I feel like if I had more time I would made it more intuative (swipe features, etc.) to the typical app functionality today.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I think that my approach was a bit different in terms of coding this time than other projects in the past.  The main class that I used to create my database functiosn from was a module that was imported into other classes to extend the functionality.  So, instead of doing it one class at a time, I worked through it as one function at a time, which made it a lot easier to test the functionality of each piece rather than the app as a whole.  This will be helpful in the future when using Agile concepts to develop other software. 

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the code after the development of each function that met a user need or objective of the application. Testing the functionality would help uncover any bugs that I might have introduced between each testing period.  Testing incrementally is important to make sure that the software is meeting each piece of functionality properly before going on to the next step of development.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I think the biggest challenge that I had to overcome throughout the development process is adjusting the functional components either due to overambition or coming across roadblocks that make meeting the functional component a challenge.  For example, I wanted to use swipe features for my edit and delete functional requirements but was having issues with the implmentation so switching it over to buttons kept the functionality with a different implementation.  I think that being flexible and able to problem solve as challenges come during the development process.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the UI/UX piece of my application was very successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience because I think that functionality can be relatively straightforward but the design process and layout can make or break an applications success.  I think that my experience in understanding how applications work and what is kind of "mainstream" in the mobile applcation world really helped me with the decisions I made of my layout and interface of my app.  I was also able to apply my experience from my previous UX/UI class to focus on a clean design that focuses on functionality and simplicity.

## CS-370 Current and Emerging Treads in CS

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, the intial coding for the environment, functionality of the game, and machine learning neural network were given at the beginning.  The code that was created by myself was the deep learning training algorithm that was used to train the intelligent agent in this pathfinding game.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are involved in the developing, testing, and deployment of software in all different sectors of human society.  They are the ones that make sure software meets the functional requirements of the user or client, makes sure that the software is secure and as bug free as possible, as well as involved in the training and development of AI.  This matters because computer scientists have a duty to make sure that new developments in the field positively impacts society as a whole.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I think that that approaching a problem with an open mind and figuring out the root of the problem is the best way to start the development process.  Then, doing research to see if there have been solutions to the problem before and if these solutions really "solve" the problem or if there is another solution out there.  After that, laying out the requirements and steps to complete the development processes as well as testing to make sure the software is free of bugs.  After the software is developed and deployed, making sure that it solves the problem it was intended to, as well as continuing to evaluate if there is more that the solution can do to help outside of the problem it intended to resolve. 

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, there are ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization, especially the field of artificial intelligence grows.  AI needs to be trained with the least amount of bias as possible because its implications could cause problems with certain groups of people that are negatively impacted by the bias.  Recognizing that the bias occurs and doing everything possible to eliminate the bias is the first responsibility of a computer scientist.  Also, making sure that personal data that is used and stored from the end users is important to keep the trust of the customer as well as required to meet certain regulation standards of different federal agencies.
